# Synfonia

A music-oriented media player built with [AvaloniaUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/) and our own fork of [SharpAudio with FFMPEG Integration](https://github.com/jmacato/SharpAudio).  

## Features:

- It can play any audio format that FFMPEG supports. 
- Gapless & seamless playback between tracks.
- Can run on Windows, Linux and macOS. Will have mobile support too once Avalonia gets it done.
- Uses modern Microsoft Fluent UI design language for that slick look.
